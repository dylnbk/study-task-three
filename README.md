# instructions
You will create a game that is like Rock, Paper, Scissors, but using comic characters.

-  The user is shown a menu during game play.
-  The user has the option to select the number of rounds played in a game. 
-  The number of rounds must be an odd number.  The program should either add a round and advise the user or display a message asking the user to choose an odd number. 
-  If the user does not choose how many rounds to play (and the option is given), the number of rounds defaults to three. 
-  The in-game menu shows a list of game characters to choose from.
-  The in-game menu shows all five characters from the grid.
-  If the user chooses an invalid character, an error message is displayed, and play continues without adding to the scores or rounds played. 
-  On choosing a character, the user sees a message showing which character was chosen by both user and computer. 
-  After each round, if a character won, the user sees the winning message for the winning character. 
- After each round, the user sees the winning player (computer, user, or equivalent) and the character they chose. 
- If the user and computer choose the same character, the user sees a message that tells them it is a draw.  No score is given to either player. 
- A score for computer and user is shown after each round. 
- At the end of a game of at least three rounds, the winner is displayed.
